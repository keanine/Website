        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
          SoundWave is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with a rhythm game twist! Dodge obstacles 
          and anticipate hazards by paying close attention to the beat of the song.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game was based off of our entry into Global Games Jam 2017 with the theme "waves".
          Our original game was about navigating rhythm based obstacles while guiding your
          AI companion by waving at them, however for the full release we decided it would be better
          to focus on just one of the mechanics so that we could polish it for release. Unfortunately
          this meant that the companion character was dropped from the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our skills as a team had improved since the original game jam entry from 5 years prior. Because of this we decided it would be best
          to start from scratch, however we once again used Unity to reimagine the project.
          I was in charge of developing the character controller as well as the rhythm mechanics and
          the objects that moved to the beat. I worked with our designer to implement these new
          mechanics in a way so that they could be tweaked from the inspector without having
          to write additional code to create new behaviours, allowing levels to be made far more easily.
        </p>

        <p>
          As hobbyist developers with day jobs our biggest struggle was time-management. We initially
          scoped the game to take about a month to develop, however this turned into a 4 month development cycle.
          Around the end of month 3 we decided that our current approach wasn't working, and rather than working on it
          whenever we felt like it, we created a Trello board and scheduled time to work together in the evenings.
          In the following month we made considerable progress, and a portion of that time was spent 
          polishing and bug-fixing before release.
