        <h1>Details</h1>
                    <p>
                        SoundWave is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with a rhythm game twist! Dodge obstacles and anticipate hazards by paying close attention to the beat of the song.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This game was based off of our entry for Global Games Jam 2017 with the theme "waves". 
                        Our original game was about navigating rhythm based obstacles while guiding your AI companion, 
                        however for the full release we decided it would be better to focus on just one of the mechanics
                        so that we develop it further. Unfortunately this meant that the companion character was dropped
                        from the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We used Unity and C# to reimagine the project. I was in charge
                        of developing the character controller as well as the rhythm mechanics. I worked with our designer
                        to implement these new mechanics so that the rhythm objects could be tweaked from the inspector
                        without having to write additional code to create new behaviours, allowing levels to be made
                        far more easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As hobbyist developers with day jobs our biggest struggle was time-management. We initially
                        planned to finish the project within a month, but it ended up taking four months. Around the end 
                        of month 3 we decided that our current relaxed approach wasn't working, so we created a Trello 
                        board and scheduled time to work together in the evenings. In the following month we made considerable
                        progress, and a portion of that time was spent polishing and bug-fixing before release.
                    </p>
