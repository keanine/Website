        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
		  Unlock Luigi and play through the Mario 64 levels you know and love from a new perspective. Help Luigi collect all 120 Green Stars with his new movement and unlock a fun reward!
		  Green Stars cannot be used to open the castle doors since they do not have the same energy as Power Stars. Looks like Mario has to do all the important work once again, despite Luigiâ€™s efforts!
        </p>

		  This mod was created using the <a href="https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port">SM64 Port</a>, a PC port of Super Mario 64 based on the <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64">Super Mario 64 decompilation project</a>, which allows you to decompile the original N64 game into documented C code! I took a little time to learn how some of the systems worked, and decided to work on this Luigi mod in order to put what I had learnt into practice! This is my first time working with pure C code, but thanks to my knowledge of C++ and my limited understanding of C practices from University I was able to create this project with little resistance!
        </p>
		<p>
		  I gained a fair amount of traction with this mod, as of the time of writing the release video in the media section below is sitting at over 7000 views, 166 likes and 1 dislike. As well as this, a showcase of my mod by a channel called Unreal gained more than 46,000 views, 1100 likes and 36 dislikes. People appeared to be very happy with my work and I even got some DMs from people who tried it showing their appreciation!

        <h1>Download</h1>
        <p>
		  The following download is a git patch file for SM64 Port. It contains all my code changes if you would like to take a look. I cannot provide a download to a compiled version of the game for legal reasons, but please feel free to patch the game for yourself! In order to access Luigi, you will either have to collect 24 coins in a level and set the life counter to 1, then go to the castle courtyard and talk to the Boo in the fountain! Or just beat the game with 120 stars!
