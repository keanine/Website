        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
          The Forge Engine is a Work in Progress game engine created as 
          part of a module that tried to simulate working in a game studio environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The engine was conceptualised to create a set of platformer games, 
          however the flexibility of the engine means that we could potentially use it
          for other types of games due to the lua scripting and hierarchical structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front-end was designed with C# WPF and uses CLI to access the Engine Core 
          which was developed in C++. The engine can also create builds with an executable file. 
          Since this project is a work in progress, more information will be added to this entry 
          as more is added, as well as a demo of the engine and a demo of a platformer created in the 
          engine!
        </p>
