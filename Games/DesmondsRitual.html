        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
          Desmond's Ritual is a puzzle game for PC and Android in which you try to summon the all
          powerful demon, Desmond! You must use the clues in order to complete combinations of
          ingredients, so that you can complete the ritual. This game was created during Global
          Games Jam 2016 in 48 hours.

          This was the first time that I worked on a game with a team that consisted of more than
          two people, so it was definitely a learning experience for me. Our time management wasn't
          fantastic and most of us ended up getting very little sleep. As well as this, we learnt the
          importance of version control. With this project, we actually did not use it and struggled
          with making sure everyones work was implemented and up to date as a result.
