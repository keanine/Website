          Puzzle your way through various different rooms and chambers by using your reflective
          shield to reflect all sorts of dangerous paraphernalia! Reflect bullets into buttons,
          and lasers into sensors to open doors and progress through the levels. If a singleplayer
          experience isn't your sort of thing, why not try out the arena. Here you can challenge
          your friends and foes into a match of Reflection. Use the bullets and/or lasers in your
          chosen map to take out the other player, and use mutators to change up the battle!
        </p>

          Reflection was made in Unity 5, and is close to being complete. The base mechanics are
          tight and the reflection itself is accurate enough to be indistinguishable for players.

          Reflection is a puzzle game made in Unity that is currently still in development.
          The player has a pong-like paddle and uses an accurate reflection model to direct
          projectiles away from them and use it to solve puzzles such as reflecting a laser
          to hit a switch or a projectile to hit a enemy to move them out the way.
