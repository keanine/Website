          Guide your companion using commands through challenging puzzles using the soundwaves
          to anticipate obstacles.

        <p>
          This game was created for Global Games Jam 2017 in 48 hours, where the theme was "waves". Our
          team went through a few iterations of game ideas at first, but eventually we settled
          on a game in which you wave to your companion to make them follow you. It was only
          after development had started that we decided to add in the main mechanic of sound wave!
        </p>
        <p>
          Music is a very important part of Sound-Wave. Obstacles only move on the beat,
          so you need to time your moves carefully as to avoid the drills and lasers!
          This isn't all though, as you still need to guide your friend by calling him
          and getting him to jump over the obstacles in his way. In one particular level
          at the end, you must do some difficult platforming in order to reach a button
          at the top, but there is a closed door in the way! In order to get past it, you
          need to tell your friend to stay on a button at the beginning. However there is
          a laser that fires over the button every 4 beats. This means that while you are
          platforming, you must time your command for your friend to jump as well!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the Games Jam even started we encountered a pretty big issue. Three of the
          six members of our team dropped out a few days before the event due to other
          commitments. This demoralised the remaining members of the team including myself,
          however we decided to push ahead anyway and see what we could do as a smaller
          group! I am very happy with the product we ended up with over those 48 hours,
          and our scope and time management turned out far better than <a href="DesmondsRitual.html">last years attempt.</a>
