                        This game was based off of our entry for Global Games Jam 2017 with the theme "<em>waves</em>". 
                        Our original game was about navigating rhythm based obstacles while guiding your AI companion, 
                        however for the full release we decided it would be better to focus on just one of the mechanics
                        so that we develop it further. Unfortunately this meant that the companion character was dropped
                        from the game.

                        planned to finish the project within a month, but it ended up taking four months. Around the end 
                        of month 3 we decided that our current relaxed approach wasn't working, so we created a <em>Trello</em>
                        board and scheduled time to work together in the evenings. In the following month we made considerable
                        progress, and a portion of that time was spent polishing and bug-fixing before release.
