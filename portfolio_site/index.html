                        Our original game was about navigating rhythm based obstacles while guiding your AI companion, 
                        however for the full release we decided it would be better to focus on just one of the mechanics
                        so that we develop it further. Unfortunately this meant that the companion character was dropped
                        from the game.

                        to implement these new mechanics so that the rhythm objects could be tweaked from the inspector
                        without having to write additional code to create new behaviours, allowing levels to be made

                        of month 3 we decided that our current relaxed approach wasn't working, so we created a <em>Trello</em> 
                        board and scheduled time to work together in the evenings. In the following month we made considerable
