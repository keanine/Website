                        On this website you will find the projects that I'm the most proud of. In my spare time I like to do a lot of smaller C# Unity projects, sometimes based off of my own ideas and sometimes just trying to replicate existing mechanics I enjoy in other games.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        My core skills are in C++ and C#, however sometimes I will try something a little different in order to expand my skillset. In the past I have used different languages such as Java, C and even HTML/Javascript. This website is a project I started in college, and I have been iterating upon it over the years.

                        Rental Car Derby is a demolition derby game where you have to avoid taking damage as much as possible! We decided to use the theme from the 2023 
                        GMTK Game Jam, <em>Roles Reversed</em>, in order to brainstorm the idea for this game, and imposed a 48 hour restriction on ourselves. This session allowed us 
                        to come up with a game idea we believe was fairly unique and very interesting to all of us on the team.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text text_left">
                        Our goal for this project was to have a complete experience from beginning to end within the time-limit. For this reason we decided to use <em>Unity</em>, 
                        which we all have ample experience with. Our team consisted of four developers including myself. Each member of the team assisted with programming the game 
                        and worked where needed. My primary focus was on car collisions and dynamic model deformation, however I also worked on other aspects alongside other 
                        members of the team such as the camera, the game loop and sound systems as well as bug fixes and modifications to other systems where needed.

						This project went very smoothly, and all members of the team were consistently communicating and contributing to the project to make the game fully functional. 
                        We were able to use our previous experiences in order to design and create a project with the correct scope that could be completed before the deadline. 
                        We used <em>Trello</em> in order to separate the different tasks and assigned ourselves to any tasks that we were currently working on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text text_right">
                        After completing the jam successfully, myself and another member of the team decided to continue working on the project for another week in a smaller 
                        capacity in order to polish it into an even more complete experience. This included improving deformations and damage caclulation further, adding a 
                        trick system for prize money, new custom mud shaders, rebalancing the arena, adding a quick play option and more. The version being showcased is the 
                        polished version of the project.

                        This game was based off of our entry for Global Games Jam 2017 with the theme "<em>waves</em>". 
                        Our original game was about navigating rhythm based obstacles while guiding your AI companion, 
                        however for the full release we decided it would be better to focus on just one of the mechanics
                        so that we develop it further. Unfortunately this meant that the companion character was dropped
                        from the game.

                        We used <em>Unity</em> and <em>C#</em> to reimagine the project. I was in charge
                        of developing the character controller as well as the rhythm mechanics. I worked with our designer
                        to implement these new mechanics so that the rhythm objects could be tweaked from the inspector
                        without having to write additional code to create new behaviours, allowing levels to be made
                        far more easily.

                        As hobbyist developers with day jobs our biggest struggle was time-management. We initially
                        planned to finish the project within a month, but it ended up taking four months. Around the end 
                        of month 3 we decided that our current relaxed approach wasn't working, so we created a <em>Trello</em>
                        board and scheduled time to work together in the evenings. In the following month we made considerable
                        progress, and a portion of that time was spent polishing and bug-fixing before release.

                        This mod was created using the SM64 Port, a PC port of Super Mario 64 based on the Super Mario 64 decompilation project, which allows you to decompile 
                        the original N64 game into documented C code! I took a little time to learn how some of the systems worked, and decided to work on this Luigi mod in 
                        order to put what I had learnt into practice! This is my first time working with pure C code, but thanks to my knowledge of C++ and my basic understanding 
                        of C practices from University I was able to create this project with only a little resistance!

                        I gained a fair amount of traction with this mod, as of the time of writing the release video is sitting at over 12,000 
                        views and has a 97.2% like ratio. As well as this, a showcase of my mod by a channel called Unreal gained more than 70,000 views and 1300 likes 
                        (It also only had 36 dislikes before they were removed from YouTube). People appeared to be very happy with my work and I even got some DMs 
                        from people who tried it showing their appreciation!

                    <p class="text text_right">
                        The idea for the mod came from an old rumour that stated that the plaque in the courtyard of the castle says "L is Real 2401". Many theories stated that 
                        you could unlock Luigi by doing an action such as running around the plaque 2401 times. For my version I made it a little more plausible to attain so 
                        that people had a chance to play with it properly, and I decided to also turn it into a completion bonus! I had a lot of fun learning how Mario controls 
                        in this old Nintendo 64 game and loved figuring out how to solve issues such as changing the character model, which of course was never a feature in the game.

                    The following download is a git patch file for SM64 Port. It contains all my code changes if you would like to take a look. I cannot provide a download to a 
                    compiled version of the game for legal reasons, but please feel free to patch the game for yourself! In order to access Luigi, you will have to collect 
                    24 coins in a level and set the life counter to 1, then go to the castle courtyard and talk to the Boo in the fountain. Or alternatively, just beat the 
                    game with 120 stars!

                        When developing this game, some members of our team could only join us for short periods of time, and we ended up struggling to get the game
                        completed in time. Despite this we were proud of what we accomplished. The game was played by Mark Brown of GMTK on his livestream and he levelled some
                        critiques of the game including its high difficulty, its lack of tutorial and the fast reflexes required to trigger the active reload mechanic.

                        We all agreed with these critiques however the team was finished with the project. I decided I wanted to try and update the project to cater to these crtiques
                        to make the game as good as it could be and live up to the plans we had for it. Rather than reworking the existing game, I decided to start over, using the original
                        project as reference. I believe I was able to take the use the critique to form a more well rounded experience that was only possible thanks to the work our team did
                        on the original game and the great feedback we received.

                        sound design and artwork made by our team during the official jam timeframe.

                        The Forge Engine is a game engine created as part of a module that simulated working in a game studio environment. The module consisted 
                        entirely of programmers from the Staffordshire University Games Programming course and Computer Science course, but we all had to work 
                        on design and art for the engine and the games we made using it.

                        The engine we were tasked to create only needed to be capable of creating a set of unique platformer games, however the flexibility 
                        of the engine we designed means that we could potentially use it for other types of games due to the lua scripting, hierarchical 
                        structure and Entity-Component-System.

                        The front-end was designed with C# WPF and uses CLI to access the Engine Core which was developed in C++ using DirectX 11. 
                        The engine can also create builds with an executable file. The demonstration video embedded shows off the Metroidvania 
                        I created using this engine in a short timeframe after the engine was completed, as well as an overview of the engine itself!
