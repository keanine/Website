        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <div class="paragraphC">Hello there! My name is Keanen, and I am a programmer. I am currently studying a course at University called Computer Games Programming. I spend a lot of my spare time working on experiemental projects designed to test my skills and challenge myself to create different mechanics and prototypes in a short time frame.</div>
        <div class="paragraphL">I really enjoy using Unity at home because of how easy it is to start a new project and get straight into the gameplay scripting. I have however worked with FreeGLUT before to create my own basic engine, and I will be using DirectX throughout the next year of University.</div>
        <div class="paragraphR">Aside from programming and socialising, I'm also an avid gamer! I enjoy a good variety in the types of games I play. Recently, I have been playing Overwatch with a group of friends, and I have recently picked up Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag. I mainly game on PC and tend to develop for PC as a result.</div>

    <section class="sectTitle background b-Vain">
	    <div class="paragraphC">In the Global Game Jam 2016, me and my team decided to create a game that worked on both Android and PC! Desmond's Ritual is currently in the process of being rewritten and improved, and it is planned to be released for free on the Android Play store!</div>
        <div class="paragraphL">My most comfortable language is C#. I have been using it for Windows Forms and Unity for about 3 years now, and enjoy the flexibilty and simplicity of the structure of the language.</div>
        <div class="paragraphR">I have also been learning C++ over the past year through OpenGL and DirectX. I have created multiple projects using my OpenGL framework, and I am currently working on a DirectX 11 Engine for use in my assignments next year.</div>
